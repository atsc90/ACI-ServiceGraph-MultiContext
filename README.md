Cisco Aci is a stateless solution for network traffic, requiring the use of its Service Graph to send traffic to a stateful firewall. However, if the firewall operates in transparent mode and has numerous contexts and VLANs, sending traffic to it becomes a complex design challenge.
Fortunately, there’s a fantastic solution for this kind of design. It’s fully automated using Terraform, and all you need to do is customize it according to your specific network requirements.
